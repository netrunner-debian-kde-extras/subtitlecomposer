Planned features / known issues

* integrate waveform visuals (check out wave drawing in kdenlive editor)
* automatic correction of OCR errors
* rename "current line" to "active line"
* it's annoying to have a subtitle fail to load because of an invalid encoding issue, perhaps the "next" encoding should be tried and the error informed.
* the player controls won't appear on fullscreen mode with KDE4.2 (disabling KWin desktop effects "fixes" the issue)
* translation service could improve syncronization issues if it cooperated more closely with the subtitle
