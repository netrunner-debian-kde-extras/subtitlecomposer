  [ Martin Steghöfer ]
  * Imported Upstream version 0.5.7 (Closes: #571687, #704067, #776326,
    #799957).
  * Dropped patches regarding bugs that are already fixed in the new upstream version.

  * Updated debian/watch to new repository location.
  * The new upstream version needs GStreamer 1.x. (Closes: #785853)

  * Declared build conflict with Qt5. (Closes: #784075)
  * Suggest "mplayer2" instead of "mplayer". (Closes: #686167)
  * Removed lintian override that is both malformed (lintian complains about the override itself)
    and obsolete (lintian accepts a Build-Depends on "libxine2-dev").
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.6 (no changes necessary according to upgrading checklist).
  * Fix crash on spell checking an empty subtitle entry. (Closes: #694812)
