subtitlecomposer (0.5.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

    + debian/patches/missing_phonon_link.patch
    + debian/patches/textoverlay_fix.patch
  * No build-depend on quilt since there are no patches to apply.

    release.
  * Bump Standards Version to 3.8.2, no changes needed.
  * Added lintian overrides for ruby scripts intended to be ran using Kross.
  * Refreshed man page, generated with kdemangen.pl and edited by hand to avoid
    lintian warnings.
